## Description

This is a group project made by three students of Sapienza University of Rome for Iot course. The task was to design, develope and document a personal project making use of Nucleo-F401RE board. Our idea was to use it along with a simple homemade "radar architecture" to do obstacle proximity detection (based on distance and angle) and then visualize real-time data on a smartphone homemade app using BLE connection to pass data. Finally we broadcast a message with location of device to other smartphones through Telegram APIs.
